walk-mvc framework, PHP MVC framework
=======

As the title says, Walk-MVC is a MVC PHP framework because I thought that there weren't enough PHP MVC frameworks around =D

This project was started while I was on faculty for the subject Software Engineering for the final project name PHP and Design Patterns and since then it has come a long way to what it is now.

I'm hoping this to be a constantly changing PHP MVC project, so any help or questions or requests are wanted and much appreciated so please do contact me if interested in using it.

NOTE:
In order for the project to work, change the "/phpwalk" subdirectory in .htaccess (mod rewriting must be enabled) to the subdirectory name in your www root folder(or remove it if the application is in the root)

Regards,
Goran
