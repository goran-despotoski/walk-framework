=======

This is a MVC PHP framework because I thought that there weren't enough PHP MVC frameworks around =D

This project was started while I was on faculty for the subject Software Engineering for the final project name PHP and Design Patterns and since then it has come a long way to what it is now.

I'm hoping this to be a constantly changing PHP MVC project, so any help or questions or requests are wanted and much appreciated so please do contact me if interested in using it.

Regards,
Goran
